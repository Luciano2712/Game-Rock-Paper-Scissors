                    <p>This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the world. Apart from being a
                        game played to pass time, the game is usually played in situations where something has to be
                        chosen. It is similar in that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or
                        drawing straws. There is no room for cheating or for knowing what the other person is going to
                        do so the results are usually very satisfying with no room for fighting or error.</p>

                    <p>The rock is internationally recognized by a closed fist where the thumb is not concealed. It is
                        also one of the most popular opening moves and this is why it is considered to be one of the
                        most popular hand signals. Most players will view using the rock as an opening move to be
                        somehow aggressive but would still use it because it is easy. The rock will beat scissors every
                        time but will be beaten by paper.</p>

                <div class="fusion-text fusion-text-13">
                    <p>Paper is delivered in the same way as the rock except that in this case all the fingers and the
                        thumb are extended in a way that they all face the same direction. The vertical paper or the
                        handshake is strictly forbidden in tournaments of Rock Paper Scissors because it might resemble
                        the scissors which can lead to unnecessary confusion. Paper is one of the most challenging
                        opening moves because there is no indication of what you intend to do next. As a result, many
                        players will be concerned when you use it as an opening move to your game. Paper will beat rock
                        but will be beaten by scissors in no time.</p>

                <div class="fusion-text fusion-text-15">
                    <p>Scissors are thrown in the same way as rock where the hand is clenched into a fist but the index
                        and the middle finger are extended to the front in order to make an angle that is of 30 to 45
                        degrees in a way that would resemble a pair of scissors. The use of horizontal scissors is
                        strictly forbidden in tournaments because they can resemble the shape of paper. Opening with
                        scissors is not a very smart move because your opponent will be able to guess what your signal
                        is going to be easily and so will be able to come up with a stronger signal.</p>
                    <p>It is very important to conceal your move and to surprise your opponent if you want to make sure
                        that you will win this game.</p>
