# Rock & Paper & Scissors

Playing Rock Paper Scissors can be as simple as scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, and rocks crushes scissors, but there is so much more to the game. It is also commonly abbreviated as RPS and is a common and well-known game that is played by everyone all around the World no matter their gender, age, athletic ability or other qualities, everyone has a chance to Win! It is used to settle disputes between two or more individuals with contradicted views and resolve such issues as who gets the last slice of pizza or who will wash the dishes tonight.

For example, Rock & Paper & Scissors is a website where you can join for free and have fun playing for as long as you wish. That is our goal, put you in contact with the game, playing against the machine and get all the practice and experience that you can possibly imagine and become invencible at the game. So, are you up to the challenge!?

Responsivenes was tested and the game runs in different screen sizes.
I have also tested the website using

### Unfixed Bugs

In the file rules.html, there is a -Block of code- copied from (World Rock Paper Scissors Association (WRPSA)), when this block of code is tested in the HTML validator it shows errors due to the fact of having style in it. I choose not to fix it because the time is really short for this project submission and that part of code is from external source. After talking with my mentor about it, we decided that mentioning it here would be the best to do in due circunstances. It goes from line 28 to line 116.
